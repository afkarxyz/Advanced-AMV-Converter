**Advanced AMV Converter** is a lightweight desktop application designed to convert videos to the AMV (Actions Media Video) format â€” a proprietary format used primarily in older MP4/MP3 players. Built using FFmpeg and PyQt6, this converter features automatic black bar removal, multiple resolution options (96p-240p), and optimized encoding settings to produce AMV files with minimal file sizes, perfect for low-storage portable devices. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality and batch conversion of popular video formats including MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, FLV, WMV, and WEBM.
