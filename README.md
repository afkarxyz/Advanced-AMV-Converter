**Advanced AMV Converter** is a lightweight desktop application designed to convert videos to the AMV (Actions Media Video) format — a proprietary format used primarily in older MP4/MP3 players. This converter features automatic black bar removal, multiple resolution options (96p–240p), and a range of frame rate settings from 10 to 30 FPS. It uses optimized encoding to produce AMV files with minimal file sizes, perfect for low-storage portable devices. The application supports drag-and-drop functionality and batch conversion of popular video formats including MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV, FLV, WEBM, M4V, MPG, MPEG, M2V, M2TS, MTS, TS, VOB, 3GP, 3G2, F4V, ASF, RMVB, RM, OGV, MXF, DV, DIVX, XVID, MPV, M2P, MP2, MPEG2, and OGM.
